# Features

## checkbox votes

If a vote is added starting with a ``[ ]`` in the display name. It will be used as a checkbox.
If the underlying config is currently set that checkbox will be ticked and users see ``[x]`` in the vote menu.
This feature is optional and if you do not put any  ``[ ]`` in your config it will not be using any checkboxes.
It is only applied for ddnet-insta settings not for all ddnet configs.
It is recommended to set ``sv_vote_checkboxes 0`` at the start of your autoexec and ``sv_vote_checkboxes 1``
at the end so it does not update all votes for every setting it loads.

## unstack chat for ddnet clients

Newer DDNet clients do not show duplicated messages multiple times. This is not always wanted when using call binds for team communication during pvp games. So there is ``sv_unstack_chat`` to revert that ddnet feature and ensure every message is sent properly in chat.

## 0.6 and 0.7 support including ready change

ddnet-insta uses the 0.6/0.7 server side version bridge from ddnet. So all gametypes are playable by latest teeworlds clients and ddnet clients at the same time.

In 0.7 there was a ready change added which allows users to pause the game. It only continues when everyone presses the ready bind.
This feature is now also possible for 0.6 clients using the /pause chat command. This feature should be turned off on public servers ``sv_player_ready_mode 0`` because it will be used by trolls.

+ `!1v1` `!2v2` `!v1` `!v2` `!1on1` ... call vote to change in game slots
+ `!restart ?(seconds)` call vote to restart game with optional parameter of warmup seconds (default: 10)
